Real time collaborative document editing for office documents. Check the demo at http://www.breadsoftware.com/

Bread Docs is an online collaborative word editor that allows several users to work on the same document in real time. Users work is saved back to server and more than one person can edit the same document at the same time. Everybody's changes are instantly reflected on all screens. Users can be logged in from any device and can be anywhere in the world.

No more sending documents back and forth via email, Bread is a real time collaborative editor in browser.

A great Google docs alternative, Bread Docs offers you the flexibility to install the in-house platform on your own servers and offer all the functionality to your end users. You can install the product on a Windows or Linux machine and there are no additional requirements. Documents never leave your data center or organisation and you can install the platform behind a firewall, on an applications server and behind a SSL web server.

Bread offers true collaborative editing and comes built on an intelligent operational transform-based merging and conflict resolution system. Bread allows users to collaborate with other users quickly and all the users can see the changes in real time. The cursors across the users are synchronized and users can see the changes as other users are typing them. A built-in conflict resolution system takes care of intelligently merging the changes and ensures all user changes are added to the document. Users changes are highlighted in different selected colors and built-in chat allows real time interaction with others.
